	# B) RPi 3b/4/5 bootable media; GPT, non-ESP partition, FAT32, kernel/initrd, config.txt, cmdline.txt + some kernel command line.
	# C) Rockchip bootable media; GPT, non-ESP partition, FAT32, extlinux.conf + some kernel command line; write u-boot bin on top of GPT via Armbian sh
	# D) Amlogic bootable media; MBR, FAT32, extlinux.conf + some kernel command line; write u-boot bin on top of MBR via Armbian sh

	# General process:
	# Obtain extra variables from environment (BOARD/BRANCH for armbian); optional.
	# Obtain the latest Armbian u-boot version from the OCI registry, using Skopeo.
	# 1) (C/D) Obtain the u-boot artifact binaries using ORAS, given the version above; massage using Docker and extract the binaries.
	# 1) (A) Obtain grub somehow; LinuxKit has them ready-to-go in a Docker image.
	# 1) (B) Obtain the rpi firmware files (bootcode.bin, start.elf, fixup.dat) from the RaspberryPi Foundation
	# 2) Prepare the FAT32 contents; kernel/initrd, grub.conf, config.txt, cmdline.txt, extlinux.conf depending on scenario
	# 3) Create a GPT+ESP, GTP+non-ESP, or MBR partition table image with the contents of the FAT32 (use libguestfs)
	# 4) For the scenarios with u-boot, write u-boot binaries to the correct offsets in the image.
